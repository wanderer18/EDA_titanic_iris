# Data Exploration, Preprocessing, and Visualization with Python

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, implementing machine learning models, and creating insightful visualizations for the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the data science community and is often used for classification tasks.

The main tasks covered in this assignment are:
1. Data Exploration and Summary Statistics
2. Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values and Outliers)
3. Implementation and Evaluation of Machine Learning Models (SVM and Random Forest)
4. Visualization (Scatter Plots, Heatmaps, and Bar Charts)

## Dataset Selection Rationale
The Iris dataset was chosen for this assignment due to its popularity and simplicity. It is widely used for classification tasks and is a good dataset for beginners to practice various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label representing the species of the iris (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

## Instructions for Running the Code
To run the Python code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (e.g., seaborn, pandas, matplotlib) installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.

The code is well-documented with comments, explaining each step and task. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different parameters to further explore the dataset and models.

Please note that the code provided here assumes that the required libraries are installed on your system. If you encounter any missing library errors, use pip or conda to install the required libraries before running the code.
