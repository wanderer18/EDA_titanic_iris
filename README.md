# Lab 10 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for Lab 10 of the course. The assignment focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing Machine Learning models for two different datasets - the Titanic dataset and the Iris dataset. Each dataset is analyzed in a separate Jupyter Notebook, and the findings are presented along with visualizations.

## Dataset Selection Rationale
For this assignment, we have chosen two datasets that cover different aspects of data analysis and machine learning tasks:

1. **Titanic Dataset:**
   - Dataset Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
   - Description: The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers onboard the RMS Titanic, including details such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status. This dataset presents a classic binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not. We selected this dataset due to its popularity and relevance in the field of machine learning.

2. **Iris Dataset:**
   - Dataset Source: Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)
   - Description: The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, for three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This dataset is widely used for classification and clustering tasks in the machine learning community. We chose this dataset to demonstrate multiclass classification and explore clustering possibilities.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks for each dataset:
- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Click on the notebook filenames to open the notebooks:
  - "Titanic_Analysis.ipynb" for Titanic dataset analysis
  - "Iris_Analysis.ipynb" for Iris dataset analysis

- Follow the instructions in each notebook to execute the code cells and view the analysis.

5. For each dataset, the analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models are presented in the respective Jupyter Notebook. The code is well-structured, and comments are provided to explain each step of the analysis.

## File Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Sure! Below is the README.md file that provides an overview of the assignment, dataset selection rationale, and instructions for running the code for Lab 10, covering both the Titanic dataset and the Iris dataset:
