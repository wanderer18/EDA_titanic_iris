# Lab 10 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for Lab 10 of the course. The assignment focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing Machine Learning models for two different datasets. Each dataset is analyzed in a separate Jupyter Notebook, and the findings are presented along with visualizations.

## Dataset Selection Rationale
For this assignment, we have chosen two datasets that cover diverse topics to explore various machine learning tasks:

1. **Titanic Dataset:**
   - Dataset Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
   - Description: The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers onboard the RMS Titanic, including details such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status. This dataset presents a classic binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

2. **Dataset 2:**
   - Dataset Source: (Provide the source or link from where you obtained Dataset 2)
   - Description: (Provide a brief description of Dataset 2 and why you chose it)

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks for each dataset:
- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Click on the notebook filename (e.g., "Titanic_Analysis.ipynb") to open the notebook.

- Follow the instructions in each notebook to execute the code cells and view the analysis.

5. For each dataset, the analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models are presented in the respective Jupyter Notebook. The code is well-structured, and comments are provided to explain each step of the analysis.
